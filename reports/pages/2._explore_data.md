## Connect Database

Now let's connect to your data warehouse and explore the data. Connect to your database in the Settings menu:

## Explore the Modelled Data

This project uses [Evidence](https://evidence.dev) which allows you to add SQL to Markdown files to share and visualise data.

Find out the number of screen views using `snowplow_mobile_screen_views`:

```views
SELECT

  SCREEN_VIEW_NAME,
  COUNT(*) as SCREEN_VIEWS

FROM ATOMIC_DERIVED.SNOWPLOW_MOBILE_SCREEN_VIEWS

GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC
```

Calculate the bounce rate using `snowplow_mobile_sessions`:

```bounce_rate
SELECT

  APP_ID,
  COUNT(DISTINCT SESSION_ID) AS SESSIONS,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN SCREEN_VIEWS = 1 THEN SESSION_ID END) / COUNT(DISTINCT SESSION_ID) AS BOUNCE_RATE_PCT

FROM ATOMIC_DERIVED.SNOWPLOW_MOBILE_SESSIONS

GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY SESSIONS DESC
```

Find out details about the most engaged user using `snowplow_mobile_users`:

```engagement
SELECT *

FROM ATOMIC_DERIVED.SNOWPLOW_MOBILE_USERS

ORDER BY SCREEN_VIEWS DESC

LIMIT 1
```

## Summary
We can summarize the results in text:

- Since the app was launched there have been **<Value data={views} column=screen_views/> screen views** of the **<Value data={views} column=screen_view_name/>** with a **<Value data={bounce_rate} column=bounce_rate_pct/> bounce rate**. 
- The most engaged user has viewed **<Value data={engagement} column=screen_views/> screens** across **<Value data={engagement} column=sessions/> sessions**.
